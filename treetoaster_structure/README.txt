Files pertaining to the TreeToaster system itself:  the storage data structure, 3 view materialization options (naive search, set-based index labels, and TreeToaster's IVM), and 2 maintenance options (set-based index labels and TreeToaster's IVM).  The remaining 2 options discussed in the paper, Classic IVM and DBToaster IVM, are contained in the dbtoaster_structure files.
